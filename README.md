# **Summary of Testing Results**
In the implementation of testing, testing was carried out on 4 Test Cases with the results:
```
4 Passed
0 Failed
0 Not Executed
```
So the test result is 100% Passed

# **Report**
In testing, if you have to test one test case at a time, it will take a long time, so a **Test Suite** is made, so that you can run several test cases simultaneously, namely:
```
TS Booking
```
In the **Test Suite** there are 4 test cases:
```
TC CreateBooking
TC GetBookingID
TC UpdateBooking
TC DeleteBooking
```
